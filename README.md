The aim of this project is for me to gain some practical experience with ML techniques while researching and working on another topic I am interested in - and perhaps accurate predictions leading to $$$$. 

#TODO
Main Task
I. Build minimal Data set, Learning Algorithm, Get predictions
II. Evaulate initial results and see where to go / how to extend

General Steps
1. Data
  1.1. Find a good source
  1.2. prep data
2. Identify features
3. Implement algorithms
4. Evaulate, Optimize
5. Build app around the learning machine
